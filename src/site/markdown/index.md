Helps to clean up your Eclipse installation from duplicated plugins and features. The resolved duplicates are move into a separate folder.
So you can decide later whether to delete them.

To find bundle duplicates this program checks manifests or filenames. The newest version is preserved.
By default the cleaner removes duplicates only in the ``dropins`` folder. For more information about the usage and the command line parameters read the page [usage](usage.html).
